            <h2><span>//</span> Weapons Tier List</h2>
            <p>This tier list reflects weapon performance in the current Escalation season meta. Rankings factor in raw DPS, reliability at intended range, ammo economy, mod versatility, and how well each weapon performs across both PvE encounters against ARC machines and PvP raider-vs-raider fights. Weapons are judged at their optimal use case rather than forced into roles they were not designed for.</p>

                <strong>RAIDER TIP</strong>
                Tier lists shift with patches. The core principle stays the same: bring a weapon you can hit shots with. A B-tier gun in practiced hands outperforms an S-tier weapon with missed shots every time.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div id="assault-rifles" class="guide-section">
            <h2><span>//</span> Assault Rifles Breakdown</h2>
            <p>Assault rifles are the backbone of any raider's loadout in ARC Raiders. They offer the best blend of damage, range, and versatility, making them viable from your first drop to your last extraction. The two primary assault rifles in the current build fill different niches despite sharing a weapon class.</p>

            <h3>Vostok AR-9</h3>
            <p>The Vostok is widely considered the strongest general-purpose weapon in the game. It delivers consistent damage per shot with manageable vertical recoil that becomes nearly nonexistent once you attach a compensator. The fire rate sits at a comfortable middle ground, fast enough to win close-range fights against SMGs if your aim is true, but controlled enough for accurate mid-range engagements. Its mod pool is the deepest of any weapon, accepting barrel, optic, grip, and magazine attachments. A fully kitted Vostok with extended magazine and angled grip becomes a different beast entirely, capable of downing ARC Sentinels in a single magazine and winning most raider duels inside 50 meters.</p>

            <h3>Pioneer Carbine</h3>
            <p>The Pioneer Carbine is the weapon most raiders find first. It spawns frequently in early loot areas and comes with decent base stats across the board. The handling is quick, the reload is fast, and the iron sights are clean. Where it falls short is in raw damage output and mod flexibility. The Pioneer only accepts optic and magazine mods, which limits its ceiling compared to the Vostok. It is an excellent weapon for your first two or three minutes of a raid, but you should always be looking to upgrade once you push deeper into contested zones.</p>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>FIELD NOTE</strong>
                The Vostok AR-9 spawns most frequently in military containers and weapon crates found in mid-tier POIs. If you are landing at the edges of the map for a quiet start, expect to run a Pioneer Carbine until you rotate inward.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div id="smgs" class="guide-section">
            <h2><span>//</span> SMGs & Close-Range Weapons</h2>
            <p>SMGs excel in tight spaces, indoor environments, and the chaotic final moments around extraction points. Their high fire rates and fast handling make them devastating within their effective range, but they suffer dramatic damage falloff beyond 30 meters. Running an SMG means committing to an aggressive playstyle where you close distance before engaging.</p>

            <h3>Speranza PDW</h3>
            <p>The Speranza PDW is the best close-range weapon in the game right now. Its time-to-kill inside 15 meters is faster than any other weapon, including shotguns when you factor in consistency. The recoil pattern pulls hard up and to the right, which experienced players learn to compensate for. With a laser sight attachment, hip-fire becomes shockingly accurate, letting you strafe and shoot without the ADS penalty. The PDW shines in building interiors, underground sections, and extraction zone fights where engagement distances rarely exceed 20 meters. Pair it with a DMR or assault rifle and you have every range covered.</p>

            <h3>Drifter SMG</h3>
            <p>The Drifter is the common-spawn alternative to the Speranza PDW. It trades raw DPS for better base accuracy and lower recoil. New players often prefer the Drifter because it feels more forgiving, you can land more of your magazine on target even if your tracking is not precise. The damage difference between the two only becomes critical in high-level PvP encounters where milliseconds matter. For clearing ARC drones and basic machines, the Drifter performs well.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="snipers" class="guide-section">
            <h2><span>//</span> Snipers & Marksman Rifles</h2>
            <p>Long-range weapons are critical for open-map segments where ARC patrols and enemy raiders can spot you from hundreds of meters. A good marksman rifle lets you thin out threats before they reach you, and a well-placed sniper shot can end a raider fight before it begins.</p>

            <h3>Kestrel MK4 (DMR)</h3>
            <p>The Kestrel MK4 is the most impactful weapon in the current meta for experienced players. As a semi-automatic designated marksman rifle, it delivers high damage per shot while allowing rapid follow-up fire. Two headshots or three body shots will down any raider, and it tears through ARC armor plates efficiently. The Kestrel's real strength is its versatility at range: you can engage targets from 40 to 150 meters comfortably, covering the gap between assault rifles and dedicated snipers. Attach a 4x optic and a muzzle brake, and the Kestrel becomes an oppressive force across any sightline.</p>

            <h3>Warden Bolt-Action</h3>
            <p>The Warden is a true sniper rifle with the highest single-shot damage in the game. A headshot is an instant down on any raider regardless of armor. The tradeoff is severe: the bolt-action cycling time means missing a shot leaves you exposed for a punishing amount of time. The Warden rewards patience and precision. If you position well, hold angles, and take your shots carefully, it can single-handedly control an entire area. If you panic or rush, it becomes a liability. This weapon is not recommended for players still learning the game, but mastering it pays enormous dividends in high-stakes extraction scenarios.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="shotguns" class="guide-section">
            <h2><span>//</span> Shotguns</h2>
            <h3>Rust Belt 870</h3>
            <p>The Rust Belt 870 is the only dedicated shotgun currently in the game, and it fills its role with brutal efficiency. Within 10 meters, a center-mass shot will instantly down most raiders. Even a partial hit deals devastating damage. The pump-action cycling is slow enough that missing puts you in serious danger, but landing that first shot almost always decides the fight.</p>
            <p>The Rust Belt 870 shines at extraction points, doorways, and any chokepoint where enemies are forced to enter your effective range. Skilled shotgun players position themselves behind cover near high-traffic areas and wait for the engagement to come to them rather than chasing it. Pair the 870 with a Kestrel MK4 or Vostok AR-9 so you have ranged capability when the map opens up. Running a shotgun as your only weapon is a gamble that fails on maps with long sightlines.</p>

            <p>The Nomad LMG is a situational powerhouse. Its enormous magazine lets you sustain fire for extended engagements against ARC swarms and Sentinel waves without reloading. The DPS is competitive with assault rifles, but the ADS time is noticeably slower and the movement speed penalty while firing is significant. The Nomad works best when you have teammates covering your flanks, letting you focus on outputting damage from a stable position. In solo play, the handling penalties can get you killed against mobile raiders who strafe around your sluggish aim.</p>

            <h3>Salvage Launcher</h3>
            <p>The Salvage Launcher fires explosive projectiles that deal area-of-effect damage. It is excellent for clearing clusters of ARC drones and can stagger larger machines, buying your team time to reposition. The problem is ammo scarcity. Salvage Launcher rounds are among the rarest pickups in the game, meaning you might fire four or five shots in an entire raid. The weapon is fun and has its moments against PvE threats, but it is unreliable as a primary tool and nearly useless in PvP where raiders are too mobile to hit with the slow projectile.</p>

            <h2><span>//</span> Solo Extraction Builds</h2>
            <p>Solo extraction demands self-sufficiency. You need to handle every range, every encounter type, and every emergency alone. Build choices should prioritize versatility and survivability over raw damage specialization.</p>

            <div class="loadout-card">
                <h4>The All-Rounder (Recommended)</h4>
                <span class="slot">PRIMARY: <span class="item">Vostok AR-9 (Compensator + Extended Mag + Angled Grip)</span></span>
                <span class="slot">SECONDARY: <span class="item">Kestrel MK4 (4x Optic + Muzzle Brake)</span></span>
                <span class="slot">GADGET: <span class="item">Scanner Pulse</span></span>
                <span class="slot">CONSUMABLE: <span class="item">Med Kit x2, Stim Shot x1</span></span>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem; color: #a89478;">This build covers every range and every encounter type. The Vostok handles close-to-mid fights while the Kestrel picks off threats at distance. Scanner Pulse reveals nearby raiders and ARC machines, giving you the information advantage that solo players desperately need.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="loadout-card">
                <h4>The Ghost (Stealth-Focused)</h4>
                <span class="slot">PRIMARY: <span class="item">Speranza PDW (Suppressor + Laser Sight)</span></span>
                <span class="slot">SECONDARY: <span class="item">Kestrel MK4 (Suppressor + 3x Optic)</span></span>
                <span class="slot">GADGET: <span class="item">Noise Decoy</span></span>
                <span class="slot">CONSUMABLE: <span class="item">Med Kit x1, Stim Shot x2</span></span>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem; color: #a89478;">Both weapons suppressed means you stay off the radar. The Noise Decoy draws ARC patrols away from your path. Stim Shots let you sprint through danger zones. This build avoids fights rather than winning them, ideal for raiders who want to loot efficiently and extract without confrontation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="loadout-card">
                <h4>The Brawler (Aggressive)</h4>
                <span class="slot">PRIMARY: <span class="item">Rust Belt 870 (Choke Mod)</span></span>
                <span class="slot">SECONDARY: <span class="item">Vostok AR-9 (Red Dot + Quick Mag)</span></span>
                <span class="slot">GADGET: <span class="item">Flashbang</span></span>
                <span class="slot">CONSUMABLE: <span class="item">Armor Plate x2, Med Kit x1</span></span>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem; color: #a89478;">High risk, high reward. The shotgun dominates close quarters and the Vostok covers everything else. Armor Plates give you the survivability to push aggressively into buildings and extraction zones. Flashbang before entry, shotgun on the follow-up. This build thrives in the chaos around hot zones.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div id="squad-builds" class="guide-section">
            <h2><span>//</span> Duo & Trio Squad Builds</h2>
            <p>In squad play, specialization becomes viable because your teammates cover your weaknesses. A well-coordinated squad divides roles so that every range and every threat type has a designated answer.</p>

            <div class="loadout-card">
                <h4>Duo Setup: Overwatch + Pointman</h4>
                <span class="slot">PLAYER 1 (Overwatch): <span class="item">Kestrel MK4 + Warden Bolt-Action</span></span>
                <span class="slot">PLAYER 2 (Pointman): <span class="item">Speranza PDW + Vostok AR-9</span></span>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem; color: #a89478;">The Overwatch player holds high ground and long angles, calling out threats and softening targets at range. The Pointman pushes objectives, clears buildings, and handles close-range PvP. Communication is critical: the Overwatch must call when they cannot cover an angle so the Pointman can adjust.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="loadout-card">
                <h4>Trio Setup: Support + Assault + Recon</h4>
                <span class="slot">SUPPORT: <span class="item">Nomad LMG + Pioneer Carbine</span></span>
                <span class="slot">ASSAULT: <span class="item">Vostok AR-9 + Rust Belt 870</span></span>
                <span class="slot">RECON: <span class="item">Kestrel MK4 + Speranza PDW</span></span>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem; color: #a89478;">The Support pins down ARC machines and provides sustained fire during large encounters. The Assault player leads pushes into buildings and extraction zones. The Recon player scouts ahead, picks off distant threats, and flanks during PvP engagements. Each player covers a different engagement range, making the trio effective in every scenario.</p>

        <div id="weapon-mods" class="guide-section">
            <h2><span>//</span> Weapon Mods & Attachments</h2>
            <p>Weapon mods are found as loot throughout each raid and can dramatically change how a weapon performs. Every mod comes with tradeoffs, so choosing attachments should reflect your playstyle and your build's intended role rather than blindly stacking stats.</p>

            <h3>Optics</h3>
            <p>Red Dot sights are the fastest for target acquisition and work best on SMGs and close-range assault rifles. Holographic sights offer a slightly wider field of view. The 3x and 4x optics are essential on DMRs and snipers for effective long-range use. Avoid putting high-magnification optics on close-range weapons as the ADS zoom will hurt you in tight spaces.</p>

            <h3>Barrels & Muzzles</h3>
            <p>Compensators reduce vertical recoil and are the best general-purpose barrel mod for automatic weapons. Suppressors eliminate muzzle flash and reduce your sound signature, keeping you off both the radar and the minimap. The tradeoff is reduced damage range. Muzzle Brakes reduce overall recoil spread and are ideal on semi-automatic weapons like the Kestrel MK4 where each shot needs to land precisely.</p>

            <h3>Grips & Stocks</h3>
            <p>Angled Grips improve ADS speed, letting you snap onto targets faster. Vertical Grips reduce recoil during sustained fire, better for weapons you fire in long bursts. Stocks generally improve stability and reduce sway when aiming down sights. Choose based on whether your weapon is used for quick snappy engagements or controlled sustained fire.</p>

            <h3>Magazines</h3>
            <p>Extended Magazines increase capacity at the cost of slightly slower reload. Quick Magazines reduce reload time but keep standard capacity. For solo players, Extended Magazines are usually better since you cannot rely on teammates to cover your reloads. In squads, Quick Magazines let your designated fighter stay in the engagement longer with faster reload cycling.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="tips" class="guide-section">
            <h2><span>//</span> Advanced Tips</h2>
            <p>Weapon swapping is faster than reloading in every scenario. If your magazine empties mid-fight, switch to your secondary rather than reloading. Practice the swap until it becomes muscle memory.</p>
            <p>Sound matters more than most players realize. Unsuppressed weapons draw ARC patrols and alert nearby raiders to your position. If you fire an unsuppressed weapon, assume someone heard it and reposition immediately after the engagement ends.</p>
            <p>Ammo management defines your raid. Every bullet you fire is a bullet you cannot use later. Prioritize ammo-efficient weapons for ARC clearing and save your high-damage weapons for PvP encounters and boss-level ARC machines.</p>
            <p>Test weapons in low-stakes raids before relying on them in high-value runs. Drop into quieter zones, pick up unfamiliar weapons, and spend time learning their recoil patterns. Understanding how every weapon handles makes you a better raider regardless of what loadout you end up running.</p>
