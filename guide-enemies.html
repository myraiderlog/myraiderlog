            <h2>!! ARC Behavior & Detection</h2>
            <p>Every ARC machine operates on a scanner-based detection system with three distinct modes, each indicated by the color of light its scanner emits. Understanding these modes lets you predict ARC behavior before an engagement begins.</p>

            <p><strong style="color:#5588cc">Blue Scanner</strong> — The machine is in passive patrol mode, searching for Raider activity. It follows a set route and will continue until it detects a disturbance. You can move near Blue-mode ARC if you stay quiet and out of direct line of sight.</p>

            <p><strong style="color:#ccaa33">Yellow Scanner</strong> — The machine is alerted. It has detected possible Raider activity and is investigating the location. If it finds nothing after searching, it will return to Blue mode. This is your window to reposition or hide.</p>

            <p><strong style="color:#cc4444">Red Scanner</strong> — The machine has found a target and entered combat mode. It will attack until it loses its target. If you attack an ARC machine while it is in Blue mode, it can skip Yellow entirely and go straight to Red.</p>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>RAIDER TIP</strong>
                Unsuppressed weapons attract attention from farther away. Running generates more noise than walking. Every ARC machine has a detection radius that increases when you are in its direct line of sight. Stealth is always an option — not every patrol needs to be a fight.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="guide-section" id="armor">
            <h2>!! ARC Armor Types</h2>
            <p>ARC machines have three visually distinct armor types that tell you where to aim at a glance. Weapons with higher ARC Armor Penetration are more effective across all types.</p>

            <p><strong style="color:#ddd">Unarmored Plating (Matte White)</strong> — All weapons deal semi-effective damage. Rounds with Moderate ARC Armor Penetration or above are most effective.</p>

            <p><strong style="color:#888">Armored Plating (Shiny Dark Gray)</strong> — Requires Moderate ARC Armor Penetration or higher to damage. Anything below Moderate bounces off. Damaging Armored Plating can strip it off, revealing weaker plating underneath.</p>

            <p><strong style="color:#ccaa33">Weak Points (Matte Bright Yellow)</strong> — Damaging Weak Points deals direct damage to the ARC machine. Always prioritize yellow-colored components when attacking.</p>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>AMMO PENETRATION</strong>
                Heavy Ammo (Bettina, Ferro, Anvil) has the strongest ARC Armor Penetration. Medium Ammo (Renegade, Tempest, Osprey) has moderate penetration. Light Ammo (Bobcat, Stitcher, Kettle) has the weakest penetration and bounces off Armored Plating. Use Heavy Ammo weapons against heavily armored ARC like Bombardiers, Bastions, and Queens.

                <h4>Snitch</h4>
                <div class="stats">THREAT: LOW | XP: 100 destroy / 200 loot</div>
                <p>The Snitch is a small flying drone that loudly alerts nearby ARC to Raider presence when it spots you. It does not attack directly but acts as an alarm system. Destroy it quickly before it summons ARC reinforcements. Its thrusters are easily destabilized — one or two shots from any weapon will take it down.</p>
                <div class="drops">DROPS: ARC Thermo Lining, ARC Synthetic Resin, Sensors, Snitch Scanner</div>

            <div class="enemy-card">
                <h4>Wasp</h4>
                <div class="stats">THREAT: LOW-MEDIUM | XP: 100 destroy / 200 loot</div>
                <p>The Wasp is a flying drone that engages Raiders with light attacks. Its thrusters are unarmored and easily destabilized. A few shots will bring it down. Wasps often appear in groups, so manage your targets to avoid getting swarmed.</p>
                <div class="drops">DROPS: ARC Alloy, Light Ammo, Simple Gun Parts, Wasp Driver</div>

                <h4>Hornet</h4>
                <div class="stats">THREAT: MEDIUM | XP: 150 destroy / 250 loot</div>
                <p>The Hornet is a more aggressive flying drone than the Wasp with stronger attacks. Its rear thrusters are unarmored, making them the primary weak point. When it sounds its attack audio cue, dodge roll to avoid the damage. More dangerous than Wasps but still manageable with basic weapons.</p>
                <div class="drops">DROPS: ARC Performance Steel, Hornet Driver, Medium Ammo, Simple Gun Parts</div>
                <div class="tip">TIP: Dodge Roll when it sounds its attack. Target unarmored rear thrusters.</div>

                <div class="stats">THREAT: LOW | XP: 50 destroy / 100 loot</div>
                <p>Ticks are small ground-based ARC machines that are often heard before seen. They rush toward Raiders and latch on to deal damage. Any weapon destroys them easily. The key is reacting quickly — dodge roll as soon as one latches on to shake it off.</p>
                <div class="drops">DROPS: ARC Flex Rubber, ARC Thermo Lining, Tick Pod</div>
                <div class="tip">TIP: Listen for their distinctive sound. Dodge Roll as soon as one latches on.</div>

                <h4>Pop</h4>
                <div class="stats">THREAT: LOW | XP: 50 destroy / 100 loot</div>
                <p>Pops are explosive ground ARC that detonate when close to Raiders. Any weapon destroys them easily, but you need to keep distance. If ambushed, climb to avoid them. You can dodge roll over a Pop to bait its explosion, though the timing takes practice.</p>
                <div class="drops">DROPS: ARC Coolant, ARC Thermo Lining, Crude Explosives, Pop Trigger</div>
                <div class="tip">TIP: Climb to high ground if ambushed. Dodge roll over them to bait explosions.</div>

                <div class="stats">THREAT: MEDIUM | XP: 100 destroy / 100 loot</div>
                <p>Fireballs are explosive ARC that leave fire on the ground when destroyed. Their weak point is exposed when they open to attack — look for the white core. One Heavy Ammo round or a shot to the exposed core destroys them. Run or dodge roll away after destroying one to avoid the residual fire.</p>
                <div class="drops">DROPS: ARC Coolant, ARC Thermo Lining, Crude Explosives, Fireball Burner</div>
                <div class="tip">TIP: Shoot the white core when it opens. Move away immediately after destroying to avoid fire.</div>

                <div class="stats">THREAT: MEDIUM | XP: 100 destroy / 200 loot</div>
                <p>Turrets are stationary ARC that fire sustained projectiles at Raiders. They are immobile but deal consistent damage if you stand in the open. Bait the turret's attack, then take cover and return fire between its bursts. Heavy Ammo is most efficient — usually two shots from a Ferro or Anvil will destroy one.</p>
                <div class="drops">DROPS: ARC Synthetic Resin, ARC Thermo Lining, Light Ammo, Simple Gun Parts</div>
                <div class="tip">TIP: Bait its attack and use cover. Two Heavy Ammo shots usually destroys it.</div>

                <p>Sentinels are large, dangerous ARC machines with heavy firepower. They fire powerful shots that deal significant damage. Bait their attack and immediately take cover. The yellow canister on the Sentinel's arm is its weak point — focus fire there for maximum damage. Sentinels require a solid ammunition investment to destroy, so assess whether the fight is worth the resources before engaging.</p>
                <div class="drops">DROPS: ARC Alloy, Advanced ARC Powercell, Sentinel Firing Core, Heavy Ammo</div>

                <div class="stats">THREAT: HIGH | XP: 200 destroy / 300 core + 100 per part loot</div>
                <p>Surveyors are valuable but tricky ARC machines. Their weak point is only exposed when they fire their laser. The major challenge is that Surveyors flee at high speed when threatened. Stun them using Hornet Drivers, Showstoppers, or similar stun gadgets to prevent escape. Explosives are recommended for fast damage. The loot from a Surveyor is excellent, with its Vault being a high-value drop.</p>
                <div class="drops">DROPS: ARC Alloy, ARC Powercell, Surveyor Vault</div>

                <p>Shredders are exclusive to the Stella Montis map. They are aggressive flying ARC with devastating attacks. Their weak point is their thrusters. Never engage a Shredder without adequate cover — when it signals its attack, immediately hide behind solid cover. Heavy Ammo, grenades, or the Hullcracker launcher are recommended. This is one of the most dangerous standard ARC units in the game.</p>
                <div class="drops">DROPS: ARC Alloy, ARC Powercell, Mechanical Components, Shredder Gyro</div>
                <div class="tip">TIP: Stella Montis only. Never engage without cover. Heavy Ammo or Hullcracker recommended.</div>

                <div class="stats">THREAT: MEDIUM | XP: 100 destroy / 200 loot</div>
                <p>Spotters are target-acquisition drones that work in tandem with Bombardiers. When a Spotter locks onto a Raider, it relays targeting data to nearby Bombardiers for devastating artillery strikes. Destroy Spotters quickly before they achieve target lock. Find vertical cover (overhangs, roofs) to block Bombardier attacks if a Spotter has already locked you.</p>
                <div class="drops">DROPS: ARC Alloy, Sensors, Spotter Relay, ARC Powercell</div>
                <div class="tip">TIP: Destroy before target lock. Find vertical cover to block Bombardier artillery.</div>

                <div class="stats">THREAT: EXTREME | XP: 500 destroy / 300 per part loot</div>
                <p>Bombardiers are massive multi-legged ARC that deliver devastating area attacks. They are one of the most dangerous enemies in the game. Their weak points are the yellow leg joints and the rear canister. Heavy Ammo and the Hullcracker are most effective. Destroy any accompanying Spotters first to reduce the Bombardier's vision range. Avoid its close-range shockwave attack at all costs. Use Deadline Mines on its rear or Wolfpack Grenades for high damage. Find cover that protects both above and in front while shooting its leg joints.</p>

                <div class="stats">THREAT: EXTREME | XP: 500 destroy / 250 per part loot</div>
                <p>Bastions are slow but heavily armored multi-legged ARC walkers with powerful guns that can turn quickly. Their weak points are the yellow leg joints and rear canister, similar to the Bombardier. Deadline Mines placed on their rear or on top of their head deal excellent damage. Wolfpack Grenades are also effective. Bastions become helpless when stunned using Hornet Drivers, Showstoppers, or similar gadgets — stun-locking is the most efficient squad tactic. Use the same cover technique as Bombardiers: find cover above and in front.</p>

                <p>Leapers are fast, aggressive walkers that can close distance quickly with leaping attacks. Their weak points are the leg joints and the Eye Ball. Leapers are the highest-value standard ARC in the game — a fully looted Leaper gives 600 XP for the core plus 500 per part. Explosives make quick work of destroying them. Wolfpack Grenades are particularly effective. Like Bastions, Leapers become helpless when stunned with Hornet Drivers or Showstoppers.</p>

                <p>Rocketeers are flying heavy ARC that launch devastating rocket barrages. Their weak points are the thrusters and the area above their scanner. The silver canister on the Rocketeer's back is also a high-damage target. Two Wolfpack Grenades is one of the fastest ways to destroy a Rocketeer. This is an extremely dangerous fight in the open — always have cover available before engaging.</p>

                <strong>BOSS ENCOUNTERS</strong>
                Queens spawn during the Harvester map condition. Matriarchs spawn during the Matriarch map condition. Both are the most powerful ARC in the game at 1,000 XP for the core plus 500 per part. A coordinated squad with Heavy Ammo weapons and the Hullcracker launcher is strongly recommended.

                <p>The Queen is one of the two apex ARC machines. She is massive, heavily armored, and extremely dangerous. The strategy is to shoot off her armor plates first, then aim for the Red Glowing Core once exposed. Her legs have Yellow Weak Points that should be targeted to stagger her. Deadline Mines are most effective when placed on her head or used when the core is exposed. The Queen drops some of the rarest materials in the game including ARC Circuitry, Complex Gun Parts, Magnetic Accelerators, and the Queen Reactor.</p>

                <p>The Matriarch is the other apex ARC boss, functionally similar to the Queen but spawning during its own dedicated map condition. The combat approach is identical: strip armor plates, target the Red Glowing Core, and focus Yellow Weak Points on the legs. Deadline Mines on the head or exposed core deal massive damage. The Matriarch drops the same high-tier materials as the Queen, including the Matriarch Reactor.</p>

            <h2>!! PvP Combat Tactics</h2>
            <p>Raider-versus-raider combat in ARC Raiders is fundamentally different from fighting ARC machines. Human opponents are unpredictable and capable of the same tactics you use. The Raider who fires first wins most even-skill encounters, so awareness matters more than raw aim. Constantly scan your surroundings, listen for footsteps and gunfire, and use high ground and cover to spot enemies before they spot you.</p>

            <p>Not every Raider encounter needs to be a firefight. If you have valuable loot and a clear path to extraction, avoiding combat is often the smarter play. Fights cost ammunition, health, and time, and they generate noise that attracts both ARC machines and other Raiders. Engage when you have a clear advantage and disengage when the risk outweighs the reward.</p>

            <p>Use cover aggressively in fights: peek out to fire, then return before the enemy can retaliate accurately. Mix up your timing and angles — predictable peeking gets you killed. If a fight goes badly, break line of sight, sprint behind hard cover, change direction, and put distance between you and the engagement. Most Raiders will not chase a fleeing opponent for long because the pursuit exposes them to third-party attacks.</p>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>POSITIONING PRINCIPLE</strong>
                Always fight from elevation when possible. Never fight in a position you cannot retreat from. Control engagement distance to match your weapon's effective range. A Raider with an average weapon in a superior position beats a Raider with a perfect loadout caught in the open.
